/*You are given alphanumeric strings s and t. Find the minimum window (substring) in s which contains all the characters of t.

Example One
{
"s": "AYZABOBECODXBANC",
"t": "ABC"
}
Output:

"BANC"
The minimum window is "BANC", which contains all letters - 'A' 'B' and 'C'. We cannot find a window of smaller length than "BANC".

Example Two
{
"s": "BACRDESDFBAER",
"t": "BAR"
}
Output:

"BACR"
Here, we can see that there are 2 smallest windows - "BACR" and "BAER". However, the output is "BACR" because it is the leftmost one.

Notes
If no such window exists, return "-1".
If there are multiple minimum windows of the same length, return the leftmost window.
Constraints:

1 <= length of s <= 100000
1 <= length of t <= 100000*/

/*
 * In this approach, we create an array named frequency to keep a count of
 * occurrences of each character in string t. Now we start traversing the string
 * s and keep a variable cnt which increases whenever we encounter a character
 * present in string t. When the value of count reaches the length of t, this
 * substring contains all the characters present in string t. We try removing
 * extra characters as well as unwanted characters from the beginning of the
 * obtained string. The resultant string is checked whether it can become the
 * minimum window, and the answer is updated accordingly.
 * 
 * This algorithm uses the 2 pointer method, which is widely used in solving
 * various problems.
 * 
 * Time Complexity O(n). Since each character of string s is traversed at most 2
 * times, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) + O(m).
 * 
 * Auxiliary Space Used O(1). We are creating 2 frequency arrays of size 128,
 * hence it is O(1).
 * 
 * Space Complexity O(n + m). For storing input it will take O(n + m), as we are
 * storing two strings of length n and length m and the auxiliary space used is
 * O(1) hence total complexity will be O(n + m).
 * 
 * Note: We could use an array of length 62 (with some mapping) instead of 128,
 * but this is a general solution which works for the input string containing
 * any ASCII characters.
