Notes
A node with value equal to the value of the root node can be inserted either in the left or right subtree.
A binary tree is called height-balanced if for each node the following property is satisfied:
The difference in the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most 1.
Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes in the given BSTs <= 104
-109 <= node value <= 109*/

/*
 * In this solution, we will be using the fact that the in-order traversal of a
 * binary search tree visits the nodes in the sorted order of their values. We
 * will be extracting the nodes of the two trees in the sorted order of their
 * values and then merging them into a single sorted array. Finally, we will use
 * that array to form a height-balanced binary search tree.
 * 
 * Our approach will be:
 * 
 * Store the in-order traversal of the nodes of the first tree in the array
 * called inorder1 and of the second tree in inorder2. Merge inorder1 and
 * inorder2 into a single array such that the final array has all the nodes in
 * the sorted order of their values. That array is named merged_inorder. The
 * size of merged_inorder equals to node_count1 + node_count2. We merge inorder1
 * and inorder2 by traversing the two arrays once. Our approach for merging: Say
 * we are at index1 of inorder1 and index2 of inorder2. Initially both index1
 * and index2 equal to 0. We compare the values of nodes inorder1[index1] and
 * inorder2[index2] and push the node with the smaller value to the end of
 * merged_inorder. If values are equal, we can push any node. After this we
 * increment the index of the array whose node was added. We perform this until
 * we completely traverse at least one of the arrays. Then we push the remaining
 * nodes of the other array to the end of merged_inorder. After storing all the
 * nodes in a sorted form of their values in merged_inorder, we break the
 * connections of all the nodes with their respective child nodes. This is
 * important because parent-child connections in the resulting tree may be
 * different from that of the given trees. Finally, we use merged_inorder to
 * construct a height-balanced BST. To do it, we have to ensure two things:
 * First, for any node in the BST, the left and right subtrees must be
 * height-balanced. Second, the difference in the number of nodes in the left
 * and right subtrees must be at most 1. Our approach for this will be: Initiate
 * a process that takes merged_inorder and its first and last indices as
 * parameters. Let us call the starting and ending indices low and high
 * respectively. These must be initialized to 0 and (node_count1 + node_count2 -
 * 1) respectively. Get the middle of the current range of nodes and make it the
 * root node for the current subtree. This will ensure that the number of nodes
 * in the left and right subtrees of the current node differ by at most 1.
 * Initiate a process to build the left and right subtree of the current node.
 * For this, we will pass the index ranges as [low, root node index - 1] and
 * [root node index + 1, high] respectively. Finally, we return the root node of
 * the current subtree.
