/*Given a variety of coin types defining a currency system, find 
 * the minimum number of coins required to express a given amount of money.
 *  Assume infinite supply of coins of every type.

Example
{
"coins": [1, 3, 5],
"value": 9
}
Output:

3
Here are all the unique ways to express 9 as a sum of coins 1, 3 and 5:

1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3
1, 1, 1, 1, 5
1, 1, 1, 3, 3
1, 3, 5
3, 3, 3
Last two ways use the minimal number of coins, 3.

Notes
There will be no duplicate coin types in the input.

Constraints:

1 <= number of coin types <= 102
1 <= coin value <= 102
1 <= amount of money to express <= 104*/

		    Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);

			 * 
			 * We use 2 loops:
			 * 
			 * The 1st loop(i) iterates over 1..value. The 2nd loop(j) iterates over the
			 * given coin types. For every value of i and coins[j] we check if that i
			 * (current value to be expressed) is greater than or equals to the coin value,
			 * i.e. i >= coins[j]. If yes, then we update 
			 * dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i -coins[j]]).
			 * 
			 * After the dp table has been constructed, dp[value] will give us our answer.
