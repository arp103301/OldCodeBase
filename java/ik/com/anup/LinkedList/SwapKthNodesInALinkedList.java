/*Given a linked list and an integer k, swap k-th (1-indexed) node from the beginning, with k-th node from the end.

Note that you have to swap the actual nodes, not just their values.

Example
{
"head": [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 0],
"k": 2
}
Output:

[1, 7, 3, 4, 2, 0]
Notes
The function has two parameters: head of the given linked list and k.
Return the head of the linked list after swapping k-th nodes of given linked list.
Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes in the given list <= 100000
-2 * 109 <= node value <= 2 * 109
1 <= k <= number of nodes
Try to access nodes of the given list as little as possible*/

    If we set temp at kth node from beginning and ptr2 at head,
    and we keep on increasing both till temp reaches last node,
    then ptr2 will be at the kth node from end.

    Let's understand why? -
    When we started distance between ptr2 and temp is k - 1 links.
    We have incremented both temp and ptr2 same no of times, hence at the end also distance
    between ptr2 and
    temp will be k - 1 links.
    Now temp is at last node hence ptr2 will be at kth node from end!

    Try few examples to understand it clearly.
