/*Given an array of numbers, rearrange them in-place so that even numbers appear before odd ones.

Example
{
"numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
Output:

[4, 2, 3, 1]
The order within the group of even numbers does not matter; same with odd numbers. 
So the following are also correct outputs: [4, 2, 1, 3], [2, 4, 1, 3], [2, 4, 3, 1].

Notes
It is important to practice solving this problem by rearranging numbers in-place.
There is no need to preserve the original order within the even and within the odd numbers.
We look for a solution of the linear time complexity that uses constant auxiliary space.
Constraints:

1 <= length of the array <= 105
1 <= element of the array <= 109
