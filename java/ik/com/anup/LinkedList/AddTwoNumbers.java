/*Write a function which adds two numbers a and b, represented as linked lists of size lenA and lenB respectively,
 and returns the sum of a and b in the form of a new linked list.

Ignoring the allocation of a new linked list, try to use constant memory when solving it.

A number is represented by a linked list, with the head of the linked list being the least significant digit. 
For example 125 is represented as 5->2->1, and 371 is represented as 1->7->3. Adding 5->2->1(125) and 1->7->3(371) 
should produce 6->9->4(496).

Example One
{
"l_a": [7, 5, 2],
"l_b": [2, 0, 3]
}
Output:

[9, 5, 5]
As l_a = 7->5->2 means number 257 and l_b = 2->0->3 means number 302. Sum of 257 and 302 is 559 so, result will represent 9->5->5.

Example Two
{
"l_a": [5, 8, 3],
"l_b": [9, 4, 1]
}
Output:

[4, 3, 5]
As l_a = 5->8->3 means number 385 and l_b = 9->4->1 means number 149. Sum of 385 and 149 is 534 so, result will represent 4->3->5.

Notes
There are two input parameters l_a and l_b, denoting linked lists representing numbers a and b respectively.
Output is the head node of resultant linked list representing the sum of two numbers a and b.
Constraints

1 <= length of the input linked lists <= 100000
0 <= linked list node value <= 9
Leading zeros will not appear in the input and will not be accepted in the output.
No negative numbers.*/
