// if node has both leftchild and rightchild then this is LCA. otherwise whichever exists than that is LCA


/*Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

The LCA of nodes a and b in a tree is defined as the shared ancestor node of a and b that is located farthest from the root of the tree.

Example
Example one

a = 8, b = 9

Output:

5
There are three shared parents of 8 and 9 in this tree: 5, 2, 1. Of those three, the farthest from the root is 5.

Other examples:
LCA(2, 5) = 2
LCA(2, 3) = 1

Notes
A node is considered its own ancestor and its own descendant.
Return the value of the LCA node of the two given nodes.
Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes <= 100000
1 <= node value <= number of nodes
Node values are unique*/
