/*Properties of a 2-3-4 Tree
A 2-3-4 Tree has following properties.

Each node stores three values at most sorted from smallest to greatest.
All leaf nodes are at the same level (perfectly balanced).
An internal (non-leaf) node can either have 2, 3 or 4 children. More precisely, nodes can be of the following three types.
2-Node: Node has two child pointers and 1 data element.
3-Node: Node has three child pointers and 2 data elements.
4-Node: Node has four child pointers and 3 data elements.
A leaf node can have 2, 3 or 4 items but no children. In other words, a leaf is 2-Node, 3-Node or 4-Node where all children are Null.
