/*Write a function that returns the number of distinct binary search trees that can be constructed
 *  with n nodes. For the purpose of this exercise, do solve the problem using recursion first even if you
 *   see some non-recursive approaches.

Example One
{
"n": 1
}
Output:

1
Example Two
{
"n": 2
}
Output:

2
Suppose the values are 1 and 2, then the two trees that are possible are

   (2)            (1)
  /       and       \
(1)                  (2)
Example Three
{
"n": 3
}
Output:

5
Suppose the values are 1, 2, 3 then the possible trees are

       (3)
      /
    (2)

/*
 * The number of binary search trees can be seen as a recursive solution. i.e.,
 * Number of binary search trees = (Number of Left binary search sub-trees) *
 * (Number of Right binary search sub-trees) * (Ways to choose the root)
 * 
 * In a BST, only the relative ordering between the elements matter. So, without
 * any loss on generality, we can assume the distinct elements in the tree are
 * 1, 2, 3, 4, ...., n. Also, let the number of BST be represented by f(n) for n
 * elements.
 * 
 * Now we have the multiple cases for choosing the root.
 * 
 * choose 1 as root, no element can be inserted on the left sub-tree. n-1
 * elements will be inserted on the right sub-tree. Choose 2 as root, 1 element
 * can be inserted on the left sub-tree. n-2 elements can be inserted on the
 * right sub-tree. Choose 3 as root, 2 element can be inserted on the left
 * sub-tree. n-3 elements can be inserted on the right sub-tree. ......
 * Similarly, for i-th element as the root, i-1 elements can be on the left and
 * n-i on the right.
 * 
 * These sub-trees are itself BST, thus, we can summarize the formula as:
 * 
 * f(n) = f(0)f(n-1) + f(1)f(n-2) + .......... + f(n-1)f(0)
