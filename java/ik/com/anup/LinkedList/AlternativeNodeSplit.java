/*Given a linked list, split it into two by alternating nodes: first node goes into the first list, 
 * second to second, third to first, fourth to second and so on.

Example
{
"head": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
Output:

[
[1, 3, 5],
[2, 4]
]
Notes
The function has one parameter, head of the given linked list.
Return a list that contains two heads of linked lists.
Empty linked list is represented by a NULL value in both input and output.
Constraints:

0 <= number of nodes in the given list <= 100000
1 <= value of any node <= 1000000000*/
