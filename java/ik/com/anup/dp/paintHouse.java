/*There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. 
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. 
 * You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. 
For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; 
costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.*/
public class paintHouse {
	public int minCost(int[][] costs) {
		if (costs == null || costs.length == 0) {
			return 0;
		}

		int[][] dp = new int[costs.length][3];
///////////// row =house and column = color :::::::::::::::::::::::::::
		dp[0][0] = costs[0][0];
		dp[0][1] = costs[0][1];
		dp[0][2] = costs[0][2];

		for (int i = 1; i < costs.length; i++) {
			//ansRed=costOfCurrentHouseWithRed+ MIn(cost of prevHouse(green,blue))
			dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + Math.min(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][2]);//currentHOuseRed
			dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + Math.min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][2]);//currentHOuseGreen
			dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + Math.min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1]);//currentHouseBlue
		}

		return Math.min(dp[costs.length - 1][0], Math.min(dp[costs.length - 1][1], dp[costs.length - 1][2]));//lastcellwith differntColor
