/*
 * Depending on the position of a node in the BST, we can define a strict lower
 * and upper limit of its value. We will keep track of the permissible range for
 * a node value that can be inserted at a given position and will use those
 * ranges to build a valid binary search tree.
 * 
 * Our approach will be:
 * 
 * We will build the nodes in the order as they appear in preorder. Let us call
 * the current index in preorder as index. index would be initially set to 0 and
 * it would be passed by reference in every recursive call. Initiate a recursive
 * process which takes preorder, index and the permissible lower and upper limit
 * of the node value as its parameters. Let us call the limits as range_min and
 * range_max respectively. Initially, range_min is -inf and range_max is inf. If
 * preorder[index] does not lie in the allowed range, this means that we are not
 * at a valid position to insert the node with this value. So we return NULL.
 * This is the base case of the function. At this point, it may not make much
 * sense. But it would make sense once we look at the next steps. Otherwise, the
 * function will create a node with the value equal to preorder[index] and
 * increment index by 1. After that, it would recursively call itself two times.
 * Once for building the left subtree and once for building the right one. The
 * left subtree would have values between range_min to preorder[index] - 1 and
 * the right subtree would have values between preorder[index] + 1 to range_max.
 * We would make those calls with these ranges and without changing the value of
 * index. Upon the termination of the first call (which would finish building
 * the left subtree), index will be containing the index of the root of the
 * right subtree as per our design. So we will make the second call of the same
 * function with appropriate ranges and it will return us the root of the right
 * subtree. Finally, we will link the returned root of the left and right
 * subtree with the parent node and return the root of this newly built tree.
 * Time Complexity O(n).
 * 
 * We build n nodes and do a constant amount of work while building each node.
 * 
 * Auxiliary Space used O(n).
 * 
 * There will be O(n) number of recursive calls on the call stack in the worst
 * case.
 * 
 * Space Complexity O(n).
 * 
 * Space used for input: O(n). Auxiliary space used: O(n). Space used for
 * output: O(n). So, total space complexity: O(n).
