/*Given a linked list, reverse every group of k nodes. If there is a remainder (a group of less than
 *  k nodes) in the end, reverse that last group, too.

Example One
{
"head": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
"k": 3
}
Output:

[3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4]
Input list consists of two whole groups of three. In the output list the first three and last three nodes are reversed.

Example Two
{
"head": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
"k": 3
}
Output:

[3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 8, 7]
There are two whole groups of three and one partial group (a remainder that consists of just two nodes). Each of the three groups is reversed in the output.

Notes
The function has two parameters: head of the given linked list and k.
Return the head of the linked list after reversing the groups of nodes in it.
Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes in the list <= 100000
-2 * 109 <= node value <= 2 * 109
1 <= k <= number of nodes
Cannot use more than constant extra space*/
